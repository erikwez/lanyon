## Some pieces of information on Erik Wessel-Berg

Palo Alto born, grew up and lives in Trondheim. Educated as Phycisist, now working with computer stuff.

To quote my Twitter-bio:
geek — photography — basketball — cycling — sceptic — geek, mostly geek
This will be a dumping place for things offloaded my brain. What escapes is beyond my control.

Some Norwegian content have been approved.

## Setup

I got tired of Wordpress, and decided to go for a static site generator. After som digging around, I finally settled on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

* Theme: Based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon)
* Lanyon does not have the previous/next links at the bottom of posts. These have been nicked from the [Jekyll-Bootstrap theme](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap).
* Tags-page: Thanks to [Michael Lanyon](http://blog.lanyonm.org/articles/2013/11/21/alphabetize-jekyll-page-tags-pure-liquid.html)
* Archive page: can't for the life of me remember where I got this from.
* Categories: generated by [generate_categories.rb](https://github.com/recurser/jekyll-plugins) plugin
* Search function: [Jekyll Search](https://github.com/mathaywarduk/jekyll-search) by Mat Hayward
